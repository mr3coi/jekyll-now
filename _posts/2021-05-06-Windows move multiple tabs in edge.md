title: (Windows) Move around multiple tabs together in Edge
---

Select multiple tabs by pressing down `Ctrl`, or select a range by pressing down `Shift`.
Then drag the selected tabs together to desired location, such as:
- another Edge window to move the tabs to another window
- empty space to split the tabs out into a separate window
